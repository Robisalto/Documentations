<h1 id="basics">Basics</h1>
<h2 id="storing-seeds">Storing Seeds</h2>
<h3 id="how-to-choose-seeds-to-keep">How to choose seeds to keep</h3>
<p>You want your seeds to be as dark as possible. White seeds are immature and tend to crush under very little pressure. Small seeds are indicator of Sativa-dominant strains. In any case always use the largest seeds available.</p>
<h3 id="how-to-store-the-seeds">How to store the seeds</h3>
<p>In order to conserve your seeds what you are looking for is basically the opposite of growing protocols. What you want is a cold, light-sealed and air-sealed storing place.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Place the seeds in an airtight plastic bag.</li>
<li>Place the airtight sealed bag into a light-blocking bag or container.</li>
<li>Place the container into the vegetable space in your fridge.</li>
<li>Your seeds should remain viable for about two years.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="planting">Planting</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li>Put the seeds in a glass of water, wait until they sink. Wait for the root to start showing.</li>
<li>Once the root start to show, do not keep the seeds in the water for more than three days.</li>
<li>Then put the seeds inside a paper towel, and water them just a bit. Finally cover up the whole thing to allow for condensation.</li>
<li>Prepare the soil: mix the soil with nutrients and put it in a pot.</li>
<li>Put the seed, root down, into approximatly one inch of the growth medium. Cover it up and water the pot.</li>
<li>Make sure the water drains effectively, this will also allow for air circulation, which is essential for the plant’s well being.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="calendar">Calendar</h2>
<p style="text-align: center;">
<img src="Growing_Weed_Files/Calendar.png">
</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Seedling : 1-3 weeks</li>
<li>Vegetative : 3-5 Weeks</li>
<li>Flowering : 7-8 Weeks</li>
</ol>
<p>Total cycle = <strong>100 Days</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<strong>Lights: 18h/6h or 24h</strong>
</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<strong>Air flow: 24h</strong>
</p>
<h1 id="growing">Growing</h1>
<h2 id="seedlings-3-weeks">Seedlings <em>(3 weeks)</em></h2>
<p>For three weeks the plants are in “Seedling” state.<br />
Be careful not to over feed the plants, whether with water or nutrients. Stay alert for potential changes.</p>
<h2 id="growing-7-8-weeks">Growing <em>(7-8 weeks)</em></h2>
<p>For 3 to 5 weeks the plants are in <strong>“Growing”</strong> state, this is where the plants will grow, strengthened their branches in preparation for the weight of the buds.  In this phase air flow is very important and should be pushed to maximum settings.<br />
Keep your attention on the plants as they grow and watch for signs of deterioration. Adjust watering, lightint, air-flow… depending on the plants responses.</p>
<h2 id="cloning">Cloning</h2>
<p>The cloning procedure is fairly straight forward, follow those directions to the letter and everything shall work out perfectly. You should wait until the end of the growing phase before you start taking clones.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Cut off a new “Seedling” between 5 and 7 cm long at a 45° angle, allowing for a bigger contact surface.</li>
<li>Dip the bottom end of the new “Seedling” into cloning gel or honey. No need to go easy on it.</li>
<li>Don’t use nutrients during the first 10 days.</li>
<li>You should make multiple clones to ensure the viability of the cloning procedure.</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="flowering">Flowering</h1>
<p style="text-align: center">
<strong>Lights: 18h/6h or 24h</strong>
</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<strong>Air flow: 24h</strong>
</p>
<p>For the « Flowering » phase respect the following directives:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Be very careful with the use of nutrients. Because the plant is using its energy to flower any damage to the plant will be hard to reverse.</li>
<li>Watch the leaves to prevent any damage to the plant itself and act accordingly.</li>
<li>In case of nutrient burns, flush your plant.</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="harvesting">Harvesting</h1>
<p>Plants will be ready to be harvested as soon as the little white hairs on the flower start to turn “dark yellow”. Harvesting soon will allow for higher THC levels.</p>
<p>To see how to proceed with the harvest see the following chapters.</p>
<h1 id="flushing">Flushing</h1>
<h2 id="what-is-flushing">What is flushing ?</h2>
<p>First you have to flush your plant. Indeed flushing will allow you to get rid of all traces of nutrients and create a much better smoking experience.</p>
<h2 id="why-lush-at-all">Why lush at all?</h2>
<p>If you don’t flush your buds will contain traces of nutrients and the buds will be spoiled.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-flush">How to flush?</h2>
<p>Flushing is easy but can get messy so be ready. Put the pot a bathtub or something similar and pour water into the pot. Keep pouring and drainning water from the pot until the water comes out (almost) clear. The more cycles the better.</p>
<h1 id="trimming">Trimming :</h1>
<p>Once your plant has been flushed, you need to cut the branches from the plant and put them to dry. Trim the branches of your plant to expose the buds.</p>
<h1 id="drying-curing">Drying &amp; Curing :</h1>
<p>Now this part is very important so pay attention ! You will need to establish a schedule. Do not touch the buds directly only the stems.</p>
<h2 id="drying">Drying:</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li>Hang the buds in a dark room by the stems, make sure they do not touch each other.</li>
<li>You will need a strong air-flow, but do not point it directly at the buds as this will dry them too quickly and risk damaging the quality of the harvest.</li>
<li>Leave the buds to dry for at least a week. Watch for signs of mold (gray powder on the buds).</li>
<li>If you see mold do not hesitate cut off the infected parts and quarantine potentially sick parts or risk losing the whole harvest.</li>
<li>Rotate the buds everyday to allow for a uniform dry.</li>
<li>Once the buds are dry to the touch you can start curing them. </li>
</ol>
<h2 id="curing">Curing:</h2>
<h3 id="what-will-curing-your-weed-achieve">What will curing your weed achieve?</h3>
<p>A good cure allows your weed to continue to dry slowly, removing moisture within the bud and increasing the potency. Curing it correctly ensures good quality, smooth tasting weed that is dry and can be stored with a much lower vulnerability to mold.</p>
<h3 id="what-do-i-need-for-curing-weed">What do I need for curing weed?</h3>
<p>For a good cure that reduces the risk of mold, use canning jars, as they are airtight once sealed and the glass does not pass on any unwanted flavors to your weed. If you do not have canning jars, you can use any airtight container, but avoid using zip locks bags as air and moisture can get in.</p>
<h3 id="marijuana-canning-jars">Marijuana canning jars</h3>
<p>Keep your curing weed in a cool, dark, dry place, making an effort to keep out of the direct sunlight as this may over sweat your bud and cause mold to grow.</p>
<h3 id="curing-process">Curing process</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li>When your buds feel dry to the touch you can start curing them.</li>
<li>During the weekend: Sweat the buds for a couple of hours, then open the lid to allow the buds to become dry to the touch again.</li>
<li>For three weeks: Sweat the buds during the night and dry them during the day.</li>
<li>On the fourth week: Your buds should be ready to smoke or store.</li>

<h1 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting :</h1>
<p>No matter what marijuana plant problems you’re having, generally, there is a solution. Use the marijuana troubleshooting guide below and get your grow back on track.</p>
<h2 id="i.-seeds">I. Seeds</h2>
<h3 id="white-seeds">1. White Seeds</h3>
<p>White seeds are immature and tend to crush easily under very little pressure. If you’ve produced them, discard them. If you’ve bought them, contact your seed vendor for a refund.</p>
<h3 id="green-seeds">2. Green Seeds</h3>
<p>Green seeds are immature, but if they don’t crush under pressure, they’re usable. Germinate and plant closer to the surface as they don’t contain the stored energy of darker, more matured seeds.</p>
<h3 id="small-seeds">3. Small Seeds</h3>
<p>Some strains (mainly sativa) do not produce large seeds. Always use the largest seeds possible, but small seeds should germinate normally.</p>
<h2 id="ii.-roots">II. Roots</h2>
<h3 id="brown-slimy-smelly-roots">1. Brown, Slimy, Smelly Roots</h3>
<p>This condition is generally known as root rot and is caused by a lack of oxygen. Growth will stunt and your plant will wilt. By the time this has happened your plant may be beyond repair. To try and save it, remove any smelly and damaged roots and rinse, allowing too dry before putting back in a clean medium and container.</p>
<h3 id="tightly-packed-rootssprouting-out-the-bottom-of-the-container">2. Tightly packed Roots/Sprouting out the bottom of the container</h3>
<p>The plant is root bound, which means the rooting system hasn’t enough room to grow. Transplant your plant to a bigger container, taking care not to break any of the roots and place on top of fresh medium. This should hopefully take care of your root marijuana plant problems.</p>
<h3 id="sparse-rooting-system">3. Sparse rooting system</h3>
<p>Depending on the age of the plant, this could be a result of the roots not getting enough oxygen. In soil, make sure you are using a well aerated medium or add air stone to your hydroponic reservoir.</p>
<h2 id="iii.-stems">III. Stems</h2>
<h3 id="thin-and-frailstretching-stems">1. Thin and frail/stretching stems</h3>
<p>The most common cause is a lack of light. Your lights are either too far away or you’re not supplying them with enough Kelvin in vegetative growth. Move your lights closer and bury your plant deeper when transplanting.</p>
<h3 id="brokensplit-stem">2. Broken/Split Stem</h3>
<p>Don’t panic, you can fix your plant. Use a piece of string to tie up and close the area, not pulling too tight so that you end up suffocating and damaging the plant. Support the stem while it’s healing to limit the stress.</p>
<h3 id="bending-stemsbuds-too-heavy">3. Bending Stems/Buds too heavy</h3>
<p>Lucky you. Make sure you support and tie up the branches to make sure they continue to flourish.</p>
<h3 id="stunted-growth">4. Stunted Growth</h3>
<p>This could be down to a number of issues which include; over or under watering your plant, rotten roots, insect damage or toxic levels of nutrient build up. You will not be able to diagnose the marijuana plant problems through stunted growth alone, however, there will be one or two other tell tale signs that you should be able to find on this page which will help you put your plants growth back on track.</p>
<h2 id="iv.-leaves">IV. Leaves</h2>
<p>The plant’s leaves are a great indicator of when you’re having marijuana plant problems. Whether it’s a pest, disease, or a problem with nutrient levels, the leaves are a great indicator of a plant’s happiness. If you can’t see your specific marijuana plant problems here, use our more detailed pages for Pests and Diseases and Nutrient Deficiencies.</p>
<h3 id="drooping-leaves">1. Drooping Leaves</h3>
<p>The most common cause of drooping leaves is over or under watering. Over watering is one of the most common marijuana plant problems for beginner growers. Check out our section on over and under watering plants here.</p>
<h3 id="yellowing-leaves">2. Yellowing Leaves</h3>
<p>If the leaves are yellowing with no other symptons, the plant is probably suffering from a nitrogen deficiency. Check your pH levels* and add more nitrogen to your nutrient solution. If the yellowing leaves are accompanied with browning tips which are dying back, then you may be over fertilizing. Flush your plants with clean water, using three times the volume of the container you’re growing in. Yellowing leaves also occur on plants that are approaching harvest. This is completely natural and is your weed using up nutrients to produce resinous buds.</p>
<h3 id="pale-brown-spots-throughout-leaves">3. Pale Brown spots throughout leaves</h3>
<p>This is either a phosphorous deficiency or a pest infestation. Refer to our pages on pests and diseases and nutrient deficiencies for more information.</p>
<h3 id="yellowing-between-veins">4. Yellowing between veins</h3>
<p>Is evidence of a Potassium deficiency. Check your pH balance and add to your water.*</p>
<h3 id="purplebrown-spots-andor-dark-green-leaves">5. Purple/Brown spots and/or dark green leaves</h3>
<p>Indicates a phosphorous deficiency which will also stunt the growth of your plant. Check your pH balance and add to your water.*</p>
<h3 id="white-with-green-veins-or-pale-yellow-leaves">6. White with green veins or pale yellow leaves</h3>
<p>Signifies an Iron deficiency which is likely to be caused by incorrect pH levels. Check and correct your pH levels.*</p>
<h3 id="larger-leaves-yellow-pale-new-growth-and-brown-tips-on-leaves">7. Larger leaves yellow, pale new growth and brown tips on leaves</h3>
<p>This is caused by a lack of calcium and magnesium. As always, check your pH levels as trace nutrients are likely to be locked out if this is outside of 5.8 and 6.8. Add a little dolomite lime (1tsp per gallon) or cal-mag to your water.</p>
<h3 id="edge-of-leaves-brown-and-start-to-curl-up-with-yellow-or-brown-spots-on-leaves">8. Edge of leaves brown and start to curl up with yellow or brown spots on leaves</h3>
<p>It is likely that your plant is suffering from heat burn. This can be caused by having your plants too close to your lights as well as the grow room temperature exceeding 85°F (30°C). Use our guide on lighting to make sure you’re keeping your lights the right distance away from the plant and refer to our guide on Air Ventilation for tips on how to keep your grow room at optimal temperatures.</p>
<h2 id="v.-flowers">V. Flowers</h2>
<p>It goes without saying, that this is what we grow our weed for; the tasty, smokeable flowers of the marijuana plant. Most issues are solvable, but prevention is the best cure. Check out pages on Pests and diseases and nutrient deficiencies if your marijuana plant problems are not listed below.</p>
<h3 id="small-flowers-with-hard-bumps-between-pistils">1. Small flowers with Hard Bumps between pistils</h3>
<p>Your plant is pollinated and there isn’t anything you can do. You can smoke the buds, but they won’t be as strong or tasty as sensimilla flowers. Check out our page on flowering on how to avoid this is the future.</p>
<h3 id="slow-growth-and-small-buds">2. Slow Growth and small buds</h3>
<p>There are a number of things that could be going on; over-fertilizing, bad air circulation, insufficient light, poor rooting systems. Make sure that you follow our guidelines on indoor growing to maximise your bud growing potential.</p>
<h3 id="white-powdergrayish-spots-on-buds">3. White powder/Grayish spots on buds</h3>
<p>This is gray mold and cannot be cured. Remove the infected bud(s), cutting them out an inch below the contaminated area. Take out of your grow room and destroy. This cannot be smoked as it’s very harmful. Gray mold will spread through your grow room like wild fire, spoiling your whole crop.</p>
<h3 id="leaf-discoloration-and-dieback">4. Leaf discoloration and dieback</h3>
<p>If this is late in the flowering stage, it is nothing to worry about as it is just your plant using up it’s nutrients to produce big buds. If it is early (up to 6 weeks into flowering) check your pH and nutrient solution.* For details, use our guide on nutrients.</p>
<h3 id="pungent-odours-from-grow-room">5. Pungent Odours from Grow Room</h3>
<p>This is to be expected and means you are growing good, potent weed. Our page on Ventilation contains some tips on odor control.</p>
<h3 id="white-pistils-turning-red-or-orange">6. White Pistils turning red or orange</h3>
<p>This is nothing to worry about, and is a sign that your plants are only a few weeks away from harvesting.</p>
<h2 id="vi.-drying-and-post-harvest">VI. Drying and Post-Harvest</h2>
<p>Once you have got to this stage, there are still things that can go wrong. Although it seems all the hard work is over, for the buds to reach their full potential, there is still an important process to follow.</p>
<h3 id="harsh-smoke">1. Harsh smoke</h3>
<p>The bud has been dried to fast. It takes time to get all the harsh tasting chlorophyll and sugars out of your weed. You can add citrus peelings to your bud or re-hydrate in a room with 80% humidity to start the curing process again, but you need to be more patient in future.</p>
<h3 id="buds-full-of-moldmildew">2. Buds full of mold/mildew</h3>
<p>Air circulation in the drying and curing process was poor. You cannot save moldy bud and smoking it can seriously damage your health.</p>
<h3 id="buds-taste-and-smell-of-hay">3. Buds taste and smell of hay</h3>
<p>The buds were harvested too early. A long and slow cure will help, but your bud will never reach its full potential. Our guide on harvesting will help you know when your weed is ready to harvest.</p>
<h3 id="buds-crackle-when-smoked">4. Buds crackle when smoked</h3>
<p>This is the presence of residual fertilizers in your buds. This can be avoided by flushing your plants two weeks before harvesting, but at this stage, it’s too late and should be notched up as a learning for future marijuana grows.</p>
<p>Most growers come across marijuana plant problems during a grow, knowing how and when to deal with them is the key to ensuring your grow is wasted. The above marijuana trouble shooting guide should help point you in the right direction.</p>
