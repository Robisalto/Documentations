<h2 id="stairway-to-heaven">Stairway To Heaven</h2>
<p>There’s a lady who’s sure all that glitters is gold,<br />
And she’s buying a stairway to heaven.<br />
When she gets there she knows, if the stores are all closed,<br />
With a word she can get what she came for.<br />
</p>
<p>Ooh, ooh, and she’s buying a stairway to heaven.</p>
<p>There’s a sign on the wall but she wants to be sure,<br />
’Cause you know sometimes words have two meanings.<br />
In a tree by the brook, there’s a songbird who sings,<br />
Sometimes all of our thoughts are misgiven.<br />
</p>
<p>Ooh, it makes me wonder, Ooh, it makes me wonder.</p>
<p>There’s a feeling I get when I look to the west,<br />
And my spirit is crying for leaving.<br />
In my thoughts I have seen rings of smoke through the trees,<br />
And the voices of those who stand looking.<br />
</p>
<p>Ooh, it makes me wonder,<br />
Ooh, it really makes me wonder.<br />
</p>
<p>And it’s whispered that soon, if we all call the tune,<br />
Then the piper will lead us to reason.<br />
And a new day will dawn for those who stand long,<br />
And the forests will echo with laughter.<br />
</p>
<p>If there’s a bustle in your hedgerow, don’t be alarmed now,<br />
It’s just a spring clean for the May queen.</p>
<p>Yes, there are two paths you can go by, but in the long run<br />
There’s still time to change the road you’re on.<br />
</p>
<p>And it makes me wonder.<br />
</p>
<p>Your head is humming and it won’t go, in case you don’t know,<br />
The piper’s calling you to join him,<br />
Dear lady, can you hear the wind blow, and did you know<br />
Your stairway lies on the whispering wind?<br />
</p>
<p>And as we wind on down the road<br />
Our shadows taller than our soul.<br />
</p>
<p>There walks a lady we all know<br />
Who shines white light and wants to show<br />
How everything still turns to gold.<br />
</p>
<p>And if you listen very hard<br />
The tune will come to you at last.<br />
</p>
<p>When all are one and one is all<br />
To be a rock and not to roll.<br />
</p>
<p>And she’s buying a stairway to heaven. </p>

<h2 id="sandcastles">Sandcastles</h2>
<p>I want to be your lover<br />
Tied up and twisted around<br />
I want to be your lover<br />
Till I’m underground<br />
I want to be your man<br />
But you don’t feel the same<br />
I feel it in your hands<br />
Now I’m filled with shame<br />
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I woke up in a foreign land<br />
In a castle made of sand<br />
No one wants me, no one wants me<br />
I woke up with a broken hand<br />
In a castle made of sand<br />
No one wants me, no one wants me (x2)<br />
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Blunts and madness fill my lungs<br />
And I am on the floor<br />
When the darkness salts my tongue<br />
I’ll crawl back for more<br />
I’m falling from the sky<br />
But you don’t even care<br />
I see it in your eyes<br />
A cold and blackened stare<br />
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I woke up in a foreign land<br />
In a castle made of sand<br />
No one wants me, no one wants me<br />
I woke up with a broken hand<br />
In a castle made of sand<br />
No one wants me, no one wants me (x2)<br />
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I swear one day I’ll make it right<br />
When I’m out on the other side<br />
After I spend some time alone<br />
Soon I’ll be coming home<br />
promise one day I’ll make it right<br />
Until then I will do my time<br />
There’s no place left to go<br />
Now all I know is<br />
</p>
<p>I’m locked up in a foreign land<br />
In a castle made of sand<br />
</p>
<p>No one wants me, no one wants me</p>

<h2 id="fare-thee-well">Fare Thee Well</h2>
<p>If I had wings like Noah’s dove<br />
I’d fly up the river to the one I love<br />
Fare thee well, oh honey, fare thee well<br />
</p>
<p>I knew a man who was long and tall<br />
He moved his body like a cannon ball<br />
Oh fare thee well, oh honey, fare thee well<br />
</p>
<p>I remember one night in the drizzlin’ rain<br />
Around my heart I felt an achin’ pain<br />
Fare thee well, oh honey, fare thee well<br />
</p>
<p>One of these days it won’t be long<br />
You’ll call my name and I’ll be gone<br />
Fare thee well, oh honey, fare thee well<br />
</p>
<p>Fare thee well </p>

<h2 id="dream-on">Dream On</h2>
<p>Every time when I look in the mirror<br />
All these lines on my face getting clearer<br />
The past is gone<br />
It went by, like dusk to dawn<br />
Isn’t that the way<br />
Everybody’s got the dues in life to pay<br />
I know nobody knows<br />
Where it comes and where it goes<br />
I know it’s everybody sin<br />
You got to lose to know how to win<br />
</p>
<p>Half my life’s in books, written pages<br />
Live and learn from fools and<br />
From sages<br />
You know it’s true, oh<br />
All the come back to you<br />
</p>
<p>Sing with me, sing for a year<br />
Sing for the laughter, and sing for my tear<br />
Sing with me, if it’s just for today<br />
Maybe tomorrow, the good Lord will take you awayYeah, sing with me, sing for the year<br />

Sing with me, sing for the year<br />
Sing for the laughter, and sing for the tear<br />

<h2 id="misty-mountains">Misty Mountains</h2>
<p>Far over the misty mountains cold<br />
To dungeons deep and caverns old<br />
We must away ere break of day<br />
To seek the pale enchanted gold.<br />
</p>
<p>The dwarves of yore made mighty spells,<br />
While hammers fell like ringing bells<br />
In places deep, where dark things sleep,   In hollow halls beneath the fells.<br />
</p>
<p>For ancient king and elvish lord<br />
There many a gloaming golden hoard<br />
They shaped and wrought, and light they caught<br />
To hide in gems on hilt of sword.<br />
</p>
<p>On silver necklaces they strung<br />
The flowering stars, on crowns they hung<br />
The dragon-fire, in twisted wire<br />
They meshed the light of moon and sun.<br />
</p>
<p>Far over the misty mountains cold<br />
To dungeons deep and caverns old<br />
We must away, ere break of day,<br />
To claim our long-forgotten gold.<br />
</p>
<p>Goblets they carved there for themselves<br />
And harps of gold; where no man delves<br />
There lay they long, and many a song<br />
Was sung unheard by men or elves.<br />
</p>
<p>The pines were roaring on the height,<br />
The winds were moaning in the night.<br />
The fire was red, it flaming spread;<br />
The trees like torches biased with light,<br />
</p>
<p>The bells were ringing in the dale<br />
And men looked up with faces pale;<br />
The dragon’s ire more fierce than fire<br />
Laid low their towers and houses frail.<br />
</p>
<p>The mountain smoked beneath the moon;<br />
The dwarves, they heard the tramp of doom.<br />
They fled their hall to dying -fall<br />
Beneath his feet, beneath the moon.<br />
</p>
<p>Far over the misty mountains grim<br />
To dungeons deep and caverns dim<br />
We must away, ere break of day,<br />
To win our harps and gold from him!<br />
</p>
<p>The pines were roaring on the height,<br />
The winds were moaning in the night.<br />
The fire was red, it flaming spread;<br />
The trees like torches biased with light,<br />
</p>
<p>The bells were ringing in the dale<br />
And men looked up with faces pale;<br />
The dragon’s ire more fierce than fire<br />
Laid low their towers and houses frail. </p>

</iframe>
<p>The world was young, the mountains green,<br />
No stain yet on the Moon was seen,<br />
No words were laid on stream or stone<br />
When Durin woke and walked alone.<br />
He named the nameless hills and dells;<br />
He drank from yet untasted wells;<br />
He stooped and looked in Mirrormere,<br />
And saw a crown of stars appear,<br />
As gems upon a silver thread,<br />
Above the shadows of his head.<br />
</p>
<p>The world was fair, the mountains tall,<br />
In Elder Days before the fall<br />
Of mighty kings in Nargothrond<br />
And Gondolin, who now beyond<br />
The Western Seas have passed away:<br />
The world was fair in Durin’s Day.<br />
</p>
<p>A king he was on carven throne<br />
In many-pillared halls of stone<br />
With golden roof and silver floor,<br />
And runes of power upon the door.<br />
The light of sun and star and moon<br />
In shining lamps of crystal hewn<br />
Undimmed by cloud or shade of night<br />
There shone for ever fair and bright.<br />
</p>
<p>There hammer on the anvil smote,<br />
There chisel clove, and graver wrote;<br />
There forged was blade, and bound was hilt;<br />
The delver mined, the mason built.<br />
There beryl, pearl, and opal pale,<br />
And metal wrought like fishes’ mail,<br />
Buckler and corslet, axe and sword,<br />
And shining spears were laid in hoard.<br />
</p>
<p>Unwearied then were Durin’s folk;<br />
Beneath the mountains music woke:<br />
The harpers harped, the minstrels sang,<br />
And at the gates the trumpets rang.<br />
</p>
<p>The world is grey, the mountains old,<br />
The forge’s fire is ashen-cold;<br />
No harp is wrung, no hammer falls:<br />
The darkness dwells in Durin’s halls;<br />
The shadow lies upon his tomb<br />
In Moria, in Khazad-dûm.<br />
But still the sunken stars appear<br />
In dark and windless Mirrormere;<br />
There lies his crown in water deep,<br />
Till Durin wakes again from sleep. </p>

<p>These scars long have yearned for your tender caress<br />
To bind our fortunes, damn what the stars own<br />
Rend my heart open, then your love profess<br />
A winding, weaving fate to which we both atone<br />
</p>
<p>You flee my dream come the morning<br />
Your scent - berries tart, lilac sweet<br />
To dream of raven locks entwisted, stormy<br />
Of violet eyes, glistening as you weep<br />
</p>
<p>The wolf I will follow into the storm<br />
To find your heart, its passion displaced<br />
By ire ever growing, hardening into stone<br />
Amidst the cold to you hold in a heated embrace<br />
</p>
<p>You flee my dream come the morning<br />
Your scent - berries tart, lilac sweet<br />
To dream of raven locks entwisted, stormy<br />
Of violet eyes, glistening as you weep<br />
</p>
<p>I know not if fate would have us live as one<br />
Or if by love’s blind chance we’ve been bound<br />
The wish I whispered, when it all began<br />
Did it forge a love you might never have found?<br />
</p>
<p>You flee my dream come the morning<br />
Your scent - berries tart, lilac sweet<br />
To dream of raven locks entwisted, stormy<br />
Of violet eyes, glistening as you weep </p>

<p>Wolves asleep amidst the trees<br />
Bats all aswayin’ in the breeze<br />
But one soul lies anxious wide awake<br />
Fearing all manner of ghouls, hags and wraiths<br />
Birds are silent for the night<br />
Cows turned in as daylight dies<br />
But one soul lies anxious wide awake<br />
For the Witcher, brave and bold<br />
Paid in coin of gold<br />
He’ll chop and slice you<br />
Cut and dice you<br />
Eat. You. Up. Whole.<br />
Eat. You. Whole. </p>

<p>Of all the money that e’er I had<br />
I spent it in good company<br />
And all the harm I’ve ever done<br />
Alas, it was to none but me<br />

<p>And all I’ve done for want of wit<br />
To memory now I can’t recall<br />
So fill to me the parting glass<br />
Good night and joy be to you all<br />

So fill to me the parting glass<br />

<p>Of all the comrades that e’er I had<br />

And all the sweethearts that e’er I had<br />
They’d wish me one more day to stay<br />

That I should rise and you should not<br />
I’ll gently rise and softly call<br />
