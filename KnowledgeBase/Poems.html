<h2 id="life-death">Life &amp; Death</h2>
<p>“So live your life that the fear of death can never enter your heart.<br />
Trouble no one about their religion; respect others in their view, and demand that they respect yours.<br />
Love your life, perfect your life, beautify all things in your life.<br />
Seek to make your life long and its purpose in the service of your people.<br />
Prepare a noble death song for the day when you go over the great divide.<br />
</p>
<p>Always give a word or a sign of salute when meeting or passing a friend,<br />
even a stranger, when in a lonely place. Show respect to all people and grovel to none.<br />
</p>
<p>When you arise in the morning give thanks for the food and for the joy of living.<br />
If you see no reason for giving thanks, the fault lies only in yourself.<br />
Abuse no one and no thing, for abuse turns the wise ones to fools and robs the spirit of its vision.<br />
</p>
<p>When it comes your time to die, be not like those whose hearts are filled with the fear of death,<br />
so that when their time comes they weep and pray for a little more time to live their lives over again in a different way.<br />
Sing your death song and die like a hero going home.”<br />
</p>

<h2 id="annabelle-lee">Annabelle Lee</h2>
<p>It was many and many a year ago, In a kingdom by the sea,<br />
That a maiden there lived whom you may know, By the name of ANNABEL LEE;<br />
And this maiden she lived with no other thought, Than to love and be loved by me.<br />
</p>
<p>I was a child and she was a child, In this kingdom by the sea;<br />
But we loved with a love that was more than love,-I and my Annabel Lee;<br />
With a love that the winged seraphs of heaven, Coveted her and me.<br />
</p>
<p>And this was the reason that, long ago, In this kingdom by the sea,<br />
A wind blew out of a cloud, chilling, My beautiful Annabel Lee;<br />
So that her highborn kinsman came, And bore her away from me,<br />
To shut her up in a sepulchre, In this kingdom by the sea.<br />
</p>
<p>The angels, not half so happy in heaven, Went envying her and me-<br />
Yes!- that was the reason (as all men know, In this kingdom by the sea)<br />
That the wind came out of the cloud by night, Chilling and killing my Annabel Lee.<br />
</p>
<p>But our love it was stronger by far than the love, Of those who were older than we-<br />
Of many far wiser than we,- And neither the angels in heaven above,<br />
Nor the demons down under the sea, Can ever dissever my soul from the soul,<br />
Of the beautiful Annabel Lee.<br />
</p>
<p>For the moon never beams without bringing me dreams, Of the beautiful Annabel Lee;<br />
And the stars never rise but I feel the bright eyes, Of the beautiful Annabel Lee;<br />
And so, all the night-tide, I lie down by the side, Of my darling- my darling- my life and my bride,<br />
In the sepulchre there by the sea, In her tomb by the sounding sea. </p>

<h2 id="be-a-man">Be A Man</h2>
<p>If you can keep your head when all about you<br />
Are losing theirs and blaming it on you;<br />
If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,<br />
But make allowance for their doubting too:<br />
If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,<br />
Or, being lied about, don’t deal in lies,<br />
Or being hated don’t give way to hating,<br />
And yet don’t look too good, nor talk too wise;<br />
</p>
<p>If you can dream—and not make dreams your master;<br />
If you can think—and not make thoughts your aim,<br />
If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster<br />
And treat those two impostors just the same:.<br />
If you can bear to hear the truth you’ve spoken<br />
Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,<br />
Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,<br />
And stoop and build’em up with worn-out tools;<br />
</p>
<p>If you can make one heap of all your winnings<br />
And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,<br />
And lose, and start again at your beginnings,<br />
And never breathe a word about your loss:<br />
If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew<br />
To serve your turn long after they are gone,<br />
And so hold on when there is nothing in you<br />
Except the Will which says to them: “Hold on!”<br />
</p>
<p>If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,<br />
Or walk with Kings—nor lose the common touch,<br />
If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,<br />
If all men count with you, but none too much:<br />
If you can fill the unforgiving minute<br />
With sixty seconds’ worth of distance run,<br />
Yours is the Earth and everything that’s in it,<br />
And—which is more—you’ll be a Man, my son! </p>

<h2 id="poem-at-nates-funeral-six-feet-under">Poem at Nate’s funeral, <em>Six Feet Under</em></h2>
<p>Our death is our wedding with eternity<br />
What is the secret? “God is One.”<br />
The sunlight splits when entering the windows of the house.<br />
This multiplicity exists in the cluster of grapes;<br />
It is not in the juice made from the grapes.<br />
For he who is living in the Light of God,<br />
The death of the carnal soul is a blessing.<br />
Regarding him, say neither bad nor good,<br />
For he is gone beyond the good and the bad.<br />
Fix your eyes on God and do not talk about what is invisible,<br />
So that he may place another look in your eyes.<br />
It is in the vision of the physical eyes<br />
That no invisible or secret thing exists.<br />
But when the eye is turned toward the Light of God<br />
What thing could remain hidden under such a Light?<br />
Although all lights emanate from the Divine Light<br />
Don’t call all these lights “the Light of God”;<br />
It is the eternal light which is the Light of God,<br />
The ephemeral light is an attribute of the body and the flesh.<br />
…Oh God who gives the grace of vision!<br />
The bird of vision is flying towards You with the wings of desire. </p>
<h1 id="maya-angelou">Maya Angelou</h1>
<h2 id="i-still-rise">I Still Rise</h2>
<p>Still I Rise<br />
You may write me down in history<br />
With your bitter, twisted lies,<br />
You may tread me in the very dirt<br />
But still, like dust, I’ll rise.<br />
</p>
<p>Does my sassiness upset you?<br />
Why are you beset with gloom?<br />
’Cause I walk like I’ve got oil wells<br />
Pumping in my living room.<br />
</p>
<p>Just like moons and like suns,<br />
With the certainty of tides,<br />
Just like hopes springing high,   Still I’ll rise.<br />
</p>
<p>Did you want to see me broken?<br />
Bowed head and lowered eyes?<br />
Shoulders falling down like teardrops.<br />
Weakened by my soulful cries.<br />
</p>
<p>Does my haughtiness offend you?<br />
Don’t you take it awful hard<br />
‘Cause I laugh like I’ve got gold mines<br />
Diggin’ in my own back yard.<br />
</p>
<p>You may shoot me with your words,<br />
You may cut me with your eyes,<br />
You may kill me with your hatefulness,<br />
But still, like air, I’ll rise.<br />
</p>
<p><strong>Does my sexiness upset you?</strong><br />
<strong>Does it come as a surprise</strong><br />
<strong>That I dance like I’ve got diamonds</strong><br />
<strong>At the meeting of my thighs?</strong><br />
</p>
<p>Out of the huts of history’s shame<br />
I rise<br />
Up from a past that’s rooted in pain<br />
I rise<br />
I’m a black ocean, leaping and wide,<br />
Welling and swelling I bear in the tide.<br />
Leaving behind nights of terror and fear<br />
I rise<br />
Into a daybreak that’s wondrously clear<br />
I rise<br />
Bringing the gifts that my ancestors gave,<br />
I am the dream and the hope of the slave.<br />
I rise<br />
I rise<br />
I rise. </p>

<h2 id="the-man-in-the-arena">The Man In The Arena</h2>
<p><code>Motivationnal Speech</code></p>
<p>It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles,<br />
or where the doer of deeds could have done them better.</p>
<p>The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena,<br />
whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood;<br />
who strives valiantly;<br />
who errs, who comes short again and again,<br />
because there is no effort without error and shortcoming;<br />
but who does actually strive to do the deeds;<br />
who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions;<br />
who spends himself in a worthy cause;<br />
who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement,<br />
and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly,<br />
so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat. </p>
<h1 id="william-ernest-henley">William Ernest Henley</h1>
<h2 id="invictus">Invictus</h2>
<p>In the fell clutch of circumstance<br />
I have not winced nor cried aloud.<br />
Under the bludgeonings of chance<br />
My head is bloody, but unbowed.<br />
</p>
<p>Beyond this place of wrath and tears<br />
Looms but the Horror of the shade,<br />
And yet the menace of the years<br />
Finds, and shall find, me unafraid.<br />
</p>
<p>It matters not how strait the gate,<br />
How charged with punishments the scroll.<br />
I am the master of my fate:<br />
I am the captain of my soul. </p>

<h2 id="always-marry-an-april-girl">Always Marry An April Girl</h2>
<p>Praise the spells and bless the charms,<br />
I found April in my arms.<br />
April golden, April cloudy,<br />
Gracious, cruel, tender, rowdy;<br />
April soft in flowered languor,<br />
April cold with sudden anger,<br />
Ever changing, ever true —<br />
I love April, I love you.<br />
