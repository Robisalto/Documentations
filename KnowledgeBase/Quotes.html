<h1 id="dirk-gently">Dirk Gently</h1>
<p>Todd : [explaining plot] More than 100 years ago, a man named Zachariah Webb built a machine that broke and went to the future where these tattooed wackos found it and used it to swap souls. They swapped Lydia with a corgi to use as leverage to stop Patrick Spring, who is actually also Zachariah Webb having jumped through time to get his machine back.</p>
<p>Estevez : [interrupting] I hate everything about this right now.</p>
<p>Todd : In 2002, after the Men of the Machine killed his wife, Patrick Spring, who was a fake identity created to be the son of Edgar Spring, who is actually Zachariah Webb, jumped forward in time to last week, destroyed the Men of the Machine, and then went to the Perriman Grand to confront his future self, which led to the young Patrick Spring accidentally killing old Patrick Spring when a kitten went off and set off a shark explosion.</p>
<p>Dirk Gently : [gives thumbs up]</p>
<p>Farah Black : Wait. So <em>that’s</em> what happened?</p>
<p>Dirk Gently : Fairly straightforward, I think.</p>
