## Stairway To Heaven

There's a lady who's sure all that glitters is gold, \
And she's buying a stairway to heaven. \
When she gets there she knows, if the stores are all closed, \
With a word she can get what she came for. \

Ooh, ooh, and she's buying a stairway to heaven.

There's a sign on the wall but she wants to be sure, \
'Cause you know sometimes words have two meanings. \
In a tree by the brook, there's a songbird who sings, \
Sometimes all of our thoughts are misgiven. \

Ooh, it makes me wonder,
Ooh, it makes me wonder.

There's a feeling I get when I look to the west, \
And my spirit is crying for leaving. \
In my thoughts I have seen rings of smoke through the trees, \
And the voices of those who stand looking. \

Ooh, it makes me wonder, \
Ooh, it really makes me wonder. \

And it's whispered that soon, if we all call the tune, \
Then the piper will lead us to reason. \
And a new day will dawn for those who stand long, \
And the forests will echo with laughter. \

If there's a bustle in your hedgerow, don't be alarmed now, \
It's just a spring clean for the May queen.

Yes, there are two paths you can go by, but in the long run \
There's still time to change the road you're on. \

And it makes me wonder. \

Your head is humming and it won't go, in case you don't know, \
The piper's calling you to join him, \
Dear lady, can you hear the wind blow, and did you know \
Your stairway lies on the whispering wind? \


And as we wind on down the road \
Our shadows taller than our soul. \

There walks a lady we all know \
Who shines white light and wants to show \
How everything still turns to gold. \

And if you listen very hard \
The tune will come to you at last. \

When all are one and one is all \
To be a rock and not to roll. \

And she's buying a stairway to heaven.  \newpage

## Sandcastles

I want to be your lover\
Tied up and twisted around\
I want to be your lover\
Till I'm underground\
I want to be your man\
But you don't feel the same\
I feel it in your hands\
Now I'm filled with shame\

>I woke up in a foreign land\
In a castle made of sand\
No one wants me, no one wants me\
I woke up with a broken hand\
In a castle made of sand\
No one wants me, no one wants me (x2) \

Blunts and madness fill my lungs\
And I am on the floor\
When the darkness salts my tongue\
I'll crawl back for more\
I'm falling from the sky\
But you don't even care\
I see it in your eyes\
A cold and blackened stare\

>I woke up in a foreign land\
In a castle made of sand\
No one wants me, no one wants me\
I woke up with a broken hand\
In a castle made of sand\
No one wants me, no one wants me (x2)\

I swear one day I'll make it right\
When I'm out on the other side\
After I spend some time alone\
Soon I'll be coming home\
promise one day I'll make it right\
Until then I will do my time\
There's no place left to go\
Now all I know is\

I'm locked up in a foreign land\
In a castle made of sand\

No one wants me, no one wants me\newpage

## Fare Thee Well

If I had wings like Noah's dove \
I'd fly up the river to the one I love \
Fare thee well, oh honey, fare thee well \

I knew a man who was long and tall \
He moved his body like a cannon ball \
Oh fare thee well, oh honey, fare thee well \

I remember one night in the drizzlin' rain \
Around my heart I felt an achin' pain \
Fare thee well, oh honey, fare thee well \

One of these days it won't be long \
You'll call my name and I'll be gone \
Fare thee well, oh honey, fare thee well  \

Fare thee well \newpage

## Dream On

Every time when I look in the mirror \
All these lines on my face getting clearer \
The past is gone \
It went by, like dusk to dawn \
Isn't that the way \
Everybody's got the dues in life to pay \
I know nobody knows \
Where it comes and where it goes \
I know it's everybody sin \
You got to lose to know how to win \

Half my life's in books, written pages \
Live and learn from fools and \
From sages \
You know it's true, oh \
All the come back to you \

Sing with me, sing for a year \
Sing for the laughter, and sing for my tear \
Sing with me, if it's just for today \
Maybe tomorrow, the good Lord will take you awayYeah, sing with me, sing for the year \
Sing for the laughter, and sing for the tear \
Sing it with me, if it's just for today \
Maybe tomorrow, the good Lord will take you away \

Dream on, Dream on, Dream on \
Dream until the dream come true \
Dream on, Dream on, Dream on \
Dream until your dream come true \
Dream on, Dream on, Dream on, Dream on, Dream on, Dream on, Dream on \
Sing with me, sing for the year \
Sing for the laughter, and sing for the tear \
Sing with me, if it's just for today \
Maybe tomorrow, the good Lord will take you away \
Sing with me, sing for the year \
Sing for the laughter, and sing for the tear \
Sing it with me, if it's just for today \
Maybe tomorrow, the good Lord will take you away \newpage

## Misty Mountains

Far over the misty mountains cold \
To dungeons deep and caverns old \
We must away ere break of day \
To seek the pale enchanted gold. \

The dwarves of yore made mighty spells,  \
While hammers fell like ringing bells \
In places deep, where dark things sleep, \ 
In hollow halls beneath the fells. \

For ancient king and elvish lord \
There many a gloaming golden hoard \
They shaped and wrought, and light they caught \
To hide in gems on hilt of sword. \

On silver necklaces they strung \
The flowering stars, on crowns they hung \
The dragon-fire, in twisted wire \
They meshed the light of moon and sun. \

Far over the misty mountains cold \
To dungeons deep and caverns old \
We must away, ere break of day,  \
To claim our long-forgotten gold. \

Goblets they carved there for themselves \
And harps of gold; where no man delves \
There lay they long, and many a song \
Was sung unheard by men or elves. \

The pines were roaring on the height,  \
The winds were moaning in the night. \
The fire was red, it flaming spread;  \
The trees like torches biased with light,  \

The bells were ringing in the dale \
And men looked up with faces pale;  \
The dragon's ire more fierce than fire \
Laid low their towers and houses frail. \

The mountain smoked beneath the moon;  \
The dwarves, they heard the tramp of doom. \
They fled their hall to dying -fall \
Beneath his feet, beneath the moon. \

Far over the misty mountains grim \
To dungeons deep and caverns dim \
We must away, ere break of day,  \
To win our harps and gold from him!  \

The pines were roaring on the height,  \
The winds were moaning in the night. \
The fire was red, it flaming spread;  \
The trees like torches biased with light,  \

The bells were ringing in the dale \
And men looked up with faces pale;  \
The dragon's ire more fierce than fire \
Laid low their towers and houses frail. \newpage

## Song of Durin

</iframe>

The world was young, the mountains green, \
No stain yet on the Moon was seen, \
No words were laid on stream or stone \
When Durin woke and walked alone. \
He named the nameless hills and dells; \
He drank from yet untasted wells; \
He stooped and looked in Mirrormere, \
And saw a crown of stars appear, \
As gems upon a silver thread, \
Above the shadows of his head. \

The world was fair, the mountains tall, \
In Elder Days before the fall \
Of mighty kings in Nargothrond \
And Gondolin, who now beyond \
The Western Seas have passed away: \
The world was fair in Durin's Day. \

A king he was on carven throne \
In many-pillared halls of stone \
With golden roof and silver floor, \
And runes of power upon the door. \
The light of sun and star and moon \
In shining lamps of crystal hewn \
Undimmed by cloud or shade of night \
There shone for ever fair and bright. \

There hammer on the anvil smote, \
There chisel clove, and graver wrote; \
There forged was blade, and bound was hilt; \
The delver mined, the mason built. \
There beryl, pearl, and opal pale, \
And metal wrought like fishes' mail, \
Buckler and corslet, axe and sword, \
And shining spears were laid in hoard. \

Unwearied then were Durin's folk; \
Beneath the mountains music woke: \
The harpers harped, the minstrels sang, \
And at the gates the trumpets rang. \

The world is grey, the mountains old, \
The forge's fire is ashen-cold; \
No harp is wrung, no hammer falls: \
The darkness dwells in Durin's halls; \
The shadow lies upon his tomb \
In Moria, in Khazad-dûm. \
But still the sunken stars appear \
In dark and windless Mirrormere; \
There lies his crown in water deep, \
Till Durin wakes again from sleep. \newpage

## The Sorceress & The White Wolf

</iframe>

These scars long have yearned for your tender caress \
To bind our fortunes, damn what the stars own \
Rend my heart open, then your love profess \
A winding, weaving fate to which we both atone \

You flee my dream come the morning \
Your scent - berries tart, lilac sweet \
To dream of raven locks entwisted, stormy \
Of violet eyes, glistening as you weep \

The wolf I will follow into the storm \
To find your heart, its passion displaced \
By ire ever growing, hardening into stone \
Amidst the cold to you hold in a heated embrace \

You flee my dream come the morning \
Your scent - berries tart, lilac sweet \
To dream of raven locks entwisted, stormy \
Of violet eyes, glistening as you weep \

I know not if fate would have us live as one \
Or if by love's blind chance we've been bound \
The wish I whispered, when it all began \
Did it forge a love you might never have found? \

You flee my dream come the morning \
Your scent - berries tart, lilac sweet \
To dream of raven locks entwisted, stormy \
Of violet eyes, glistening as you weep \newpage

Wolves asleep amidst the trees \
Bats all aswayin' in the breeze  \
But one soul lies anxious wide awake \
Fearing all manner of ghouls, hags and wraiths \
Birds are silent for the night \
Cows turned in as daylight dies \
But one soul lies anxious wide awake \
For the Witcher, brave and bold \
Paid in coin of gold \
He’ll chop and slice you \
Cut and dice you \
Eat. You. Up. Whole. \
Eat. You. Whole. \newpage

## The Parting Glass

</iframe> 

Of all the money that e'er I had \
I spent it in good company \
And all the harm I've ever done \
Alas, it was to none but me \

And all I've done for want of wit \
To memory now I can't recall \
So fill to me the parting glass \
Good night and joy be to you all \

**Chorus:** \
So fill to me the parting glass \
And drink a health whate'er befalls \
Then gently rise and softly call \
"Good night and joy be to you all" \

Of all the comrades that e'er I had \
They're sorry for my going away \
And all the sweethearts that e'er I had \
They'd wish me one more day to stay \

But since it fell into my lot \
That I should rise and you should not \
I'll gently rise and softly call \
"Good night and joy be to you all" \

So fill to me the parting glass \
And drink a health whate'er befalls \
Then gently rise and softly call \
"Good night and joy be to you all" \newpage

</iframe> 

Quedate aqui\
en mis brazos\
quedate aquipara mi,\
y no me digas que me amas\
no me digas que me adoras\
dime solo que te quedas\
una vida junto a mi\

llevame por alli\
llevame en tus anzias a un lugar\
donde ya no tenga que jurar\
donde ya no tenga que mentir\
donde solo exista para ti.\

y no me preguntes si te quiero\
que no te preocupe lo que pienso\
que yo soy completamente tuya \
a mi manera.\

pero a cambio quiero ser tu sueno\
yo no me conformo con tus besos\
quiero darte todo lo que siento y mas que eso.
