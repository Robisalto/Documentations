# Chief Tecumseh
## Life & Death

  “So live your life that the fear of death can never enter your heart. \
  Trouble no one about their religion; respect others in their view, and demand that they respect yours. \
  Love your life, perfect your life, beautify all things in your life.  \
  Seek to make your life long and its purpose in the service of your people.  \
  Prepare a noble death song for the day when you go over the great divide. \

  Always give a word or a sign of salute when meeting or passing a friend,  \
  even a stranger, when in a lonely place. Show respect to all people and grovel to none. \

  When you arise in the morning give thanks for the food and for the joy of living.  \
  If you see no reason for giving thanks, the fault lies only in yourself.  \
  Abuse no one and no thing, for abuse turns the wise ones to fools and robs the spirit of its vision. \

  When it comes your time to die, be not like those whose hearts are filled with the fear of death, \
  so that when their time comes they weep and pray for a little more time to live their lives over again in a  different way. \
  Sing your death song and die like a hero going home.” \

    ~ Chief Tecumseh (Poem from Act of Valor the Movie)

# Edgar Allan Poe
## Annabelle Lee

  It was many and many a year ago, In a kingdom by the sea, \
  That a maiden there lived whom you may know, By the name of ANNABEL LEE; \
  And this maiden she lived with no other thought, Than to love and be loved by me. \

  I was a child and she was a child, In this kingdom by the sea; \
  But we loved with a love that was more than love,-I and my Annabel Lee; \
  With a love that the winged seraphs of heaven, Coveted her and me. \

  And this was the reason that, long ago, In this kingdom by the sea, \
  A wind blew out of a cloud, chilling, My beautiful Annabel Lee; \
  So that her highborn kinsman came, And bore her away from me, \
  To shut her up in a sepulchre, In this kingdom by the sea. \

  The angels, not half so happy in heaven, Went envying her and me- \
  Yes!- that was the reason (as all men know, In this kingdom by the sea) \
  That the wind came out of the cloud by night, Chilling and killing my Annabel Lee. \

  But our love it was stronger by far than the love, Of those who were older than we- \
  Of many far wiser than we,- And neither the angels in heaven above, \
  Nor the demons down under the sea, Can ever dissever my soul from the soul,  \
  Of the beautiful Annabel Lee. \

  For the moon never beams without bringing me dreams, Of the beautiful Annabel Lee; \
  And the stars never rise but I feel the bright eyes, Of the beautiful Annabel Lee; \
  And so, all the night-tide, I lie down by the side, Of my darling- my darling- my life and my bride, \
  In the sepulchre there by the sea, In her tomb by the sounding sea.  \newpage

## Be A Man

  If you can keep your head when all about you \
  Are losing theirs and blaming it on you; \
  If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you, \
  But make allowance for their doubting too: \
  If you can wait and not be tired by waiting, \
  Or, being lied about, don't deal in lies, \
  Or being hated don't give way to hating, \
  And yet don't look too good, nor talk too wise; \

  If you can dream---and not make dreams your master; \
  If you can think---and not make thoughts your aim, \
  If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster \
  And treat those two impostors just the same:. \
  If you can bear to hear the truth you've spoken \
  Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools, \
  Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken, \
  And stoop and build'em up with worn-out tools; \

  If you can make one heap of all your winnings \
  And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss, \
  And lose, and start again at your beginnings, \
  And never breathe a word about your loss: \
  If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew \
  To serve your turn long after they are gone, \
  And so hold on when there is nothing in you \
  Except the Will which says to them: "Hold on!" \

  If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue, \
  Or walk with Kings---nor lose the common touch, \
  If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you, \
  If all men count with you, but none too much: \
  If you can fill the unforgiving minute \
  With sixty seconds' worth of distance run, \
  Yours is the Earth and everything that's in it, \
  And---which is more---you'll be a Man, my son!  \newpage


# Turkish poet Rumi:
## Poem at Nate's funeral, *Six Feet Under*

  Our death is our wedding with eternity \
  What is the secret? "God is One." \
  The sunlight splits when entering the windows of the house. \
  This multiplicity exists in the cluster of grapes; \
  It is not in the juice made from the grapes. \
  For he who is living in the Light of God, \
  The death of the carnal soul is a blessing. \
  Regarding him, say neither bad nor good, \
  For he is gone beyond the good and the bad. \
  Fix your eyes on God and do not talk about what is invisible, \
  So that he may place another look in your eyes. \
  It is in the vision of the physical eyes \
  That no invisible or secret thing exists. \
  But when the eye is turned toward the Light of God \
  What thing could remain hidden under such a Light? \
  Although all lights emanate from the Divine Light \
  Don't call all these lights "the Light of God"; \
  It is the eternal light which is the Light of God, \
  The ephemeral light is an attribute of the body and the flesh. \
  ...Oh God who gives the grace of vision! \
  The bird of vision is flying towards You with the wings of desire. \newpage

# Maya Angelou
## I Still Rise

Still I Rise \
You may write me down in history \
With your bitter, twisted lies,  \
You may tread me in the very dirt  \
But still, like dust, I'll rise.  \

Does my sassiness upset you?  \
Why are you beset with gloom?  \
'Cause I walk like I've got oil wells  \
Pumping in my living room.  \

Just like moons and like suns,  \
With the certainty of tides,  \
Just like hopes springing high, \ 
Still I'll rise.  \

Did you want to see me broken?  \
Bowed head and lowered eyes?  \
Shoulders falling down like teardrops.  \
Weakened by my soulful cries.  \

Does my haughtiness offend you?  \
Don't you take it awful hard  \
'Cause I laugh like I've got gold mines  \
Diggin' in my own back yard.  \

You may shoot me with your words,  \
You may cut me with your eyes,  \
You may kill me with your hatefulness,  \
But still, like air, I'll rise.  \

**Does my sexiness upset you?**  \
**Does it come as a surprise**  \
**That I dance like I've got diamonds**  \
**At the meeting of my thighs?** \

Out of the huts of history's shame  \
I rise  \
Up from a past that's rooted in pain  \
I rise  \
I'm a black ocean, leaping and wide,  \
Welling and swelling I bear in the tide.  \
Leaving behind nights of terror and fear  \
I rise  \
Into a daybreak that's wondrously clear  \
I rise  \
Bringing the gifts that my ancestors gave,  \
I am the dream and the hope of the slave.  \
I rise  \
I rise  \
I rise. \newpage


# Teddy Roosevelt
## The Man In The Arena

``Motivationnal Speech``

It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles,\
or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. 

The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, \
whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; \
who strives valiantly; \
who errs, who comes short again and again, \
because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; \
but who does actually strive to do the deeds; \
who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; \
who spends himself in a worthy cause; \
who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, \
and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, \
so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat. \newpage

# William Ernest Henley 
## Invictus

In the fell clutch of circumstance \
I have not winced nor cried aloud. \
Under the bludgeonings of chance \
My head is bloody, but unbowed. \

Beyond this place of wrath and tears \
Looms but the Horror of the shade, \
And yet the menace of the years \
Finds, and shall find, me unafraid. \

It matters not how strait the gate, \
How charged with punishments the scroll. \
I am the master of my fate: \
I am the captain of my soul. \newpage

## Always Marry An April Girl

Praise the spells and bless the charms, \
I found April in my arms. \
April golden, April cloudy, \
Gracious, cruel, tender, rowdy; \
April soft in flowered languor, \
April cold with sudden anger, \
Ever changing, ever true — \
I love April, I love you. \
